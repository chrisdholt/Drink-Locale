            Hi, I am Kasim (pronounced K-awesome) Siddiqui (pronounced CD-key). My parents are Pakistani and I was born in Seattle. I studied Material Science and Engineering at UW. I moved Portland to work at Intel as a FIB circuit Engineer. After 3 years I quit my job to travel around Asia with my wife. Right now I am taking a web development course at Codefellows and I plan on taking a python accelerator.
